I started this as a pet project to begin familiarizing myself with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and hopefully put together a semi-useful personal blog. After many more hours than I originally intended, I'm fairly satisfied with the result. 

### Twitter Bootstrap

Last October, I learned about [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) at Boston Startup Weekend and have been obsessed ever since. Bootstrap is an awesome tool to help kickstart the development of web-apps. My Startup Weekend team used it to build our demo project and it saved us a ton of time. Bootstrap is essentially just an easy-to-use set of HTML and CSS templates, but the additional JavaScript plugins are really fun to play around with. They have a [great demo page](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/javascript.html) that shows off some of the features. I used the "collapse" plugin for the accordion effect on this page, and the carrousel plugin to show a few photos on the "about" page. 

### Jekyll

Although I probably would have learned more about Ruby had I built the site from the ground up, I opted to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to build the site. I had always heard good things about it and it turned out to be a great decision. Jekyll generates static files based on a directory of templates, which represent different parts of the website. The net effect of this is that adding and manipulating content is *extremely* easy. In summary, I can't believe that websites were ever built without the model-view-controller architecture. 

### Zach Holman

A bit of my inspiration for the site came from [Zach Holman's blog](http://zachholman.com/), which I highly recommend both for interesting reading and for technical guidance (the site is open-source).

Anyway, I'm not exactly sure how I plan on using the blog yet, but it's been a great learning experience so far. If you have any thoughts or comments, please send them my way via [email](mailto:coogan.johna@gmail.com) or on [twitter](http://twitter.com/johncoogan).
